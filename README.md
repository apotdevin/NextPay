Your very own LnUrl-Pay server built on NextJS

## What's this?

Deploy this server anywhere, connect to your lightning LND node and you get your own LnUrl-Pay server that others can use to pay you some sats! ðŸ¤‘

## What is LnUrl?

[LNURL](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc) is a protocol that helps you interact with the lightning network without the need to have a back and forth conversation with whoever you want to pay with lightning.

With [LnUrl-Pay](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-pay.md), scan a QR code, say how much you want to pay and that's it! It's really that simple, no need to ask for an invoice and start copy pasting into your wallet.

## Setup

Deploy this server anywhere, add some environment variables and you are good to go.

**Deploy it for free on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).**

## FAQ

### Which macaroon is needed?

It's recommended that you use a macaroon that only has **creating invoice** permissions. The environment variables are never exposed to the public but better be safe than sorry.

### Does my node need to be reachable from the internet?

Yes, your node must be reachable on the internet so that NextPay can connect to it from wherever it's deployed.

### Do I always have the same LnUrl QR code?

Your QR code will always be the same! Download it, share it, print it, get a tattoo of it (maybe not), and whoever scans it will be able to pay you some sats.

### Can I see an example?

Here you can check out my own [NextPay server](https://nextpay.apotdevin.com/)
